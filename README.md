_This is the second version of the app. The first one was coded in February of 2020. I was just starting out with Kotlin at that time so the app was not at its best in terms of code. So I decided this required a complete rewrite - but I've kept some parts of the old code that looked fine to "Present Me"_
_You can check out the older project [here](https://github.com/shahimclt/starrynight) if you want to see the differences.
